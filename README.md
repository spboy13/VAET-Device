# VAET-Device
"Voice-Activated Emergency Text Device" is the device portion of the practical research study conducted in Taguig Science High School. 

The entire paper is included in the files (Thesis paper.pdf)

"Arduino Scripts" folder contains the iterations of the scripts used for the device. Simply upload it to arduino w/ necessary installed libraries. 

Training the voice recognition is an initial step in making the device work. A sample .mp3 file is included in the "Train device" folder. 

Remarks:
  1. The current quality of the project is not sufficient enough to become an entry-level product. 
  2. Suggestions and/or collaborations are deeply welcomed.
  3. Please feel free to use the repository and/or paper for any academic purposes (w/ appropriate referencing)
